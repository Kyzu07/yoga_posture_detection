# Yoga Pose Detection using Deep Learning

## Abstract

Maintaining physical health through yoga is a widely acknowledged at-home exercise practice. However, successfully performing the 82 Yoga Asanas across multiple sessions can be challenging for many individuals. Finding a knowledgeable and affordable yoga instructor becomes a hurdle for those seeking guidance. This project addresses this challenge by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) techniques, modifying pre-trained models to detect yoga poses and classify them into different classes.

## Project Highlights

- **Methodology:**
  - Utilized two pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models.
  - Employed ensemble modeling for accurate yoga pose detection.

- **Dataset:**
  - Comprised a total of 18,488 images, spanning 6 major yoga classes and 82 distinct poses.

## Key Features

- **Transfer Learning:**
  - Applied transfer learning to adapt pre-trained models for yoga pose detection.

- **Ensemble Model:**
  - Utilized an ensemble model to enhance the accuracy of yoga pose detection.

## Experiment Details

A detailed experiment was conducted, resulting in a 95% accuracy rate for yoga pose detection. The experiment focused on addressing the challenges associated with finding suitable yoga instructors by providing an accessible and automated solution for individuals.
